* **Front-End:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Data:** [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/) for all statistical data.
* **Development:** Git & GitHub (Feature Branch Workflow).
* **Styles:** The site's global styles are controlled by `style.css` (layout, typography, color) and `media.css` (responsiveness). Each feature folder (e.g., `fixtures/`) also contains its own specific stylesheet (e.g., `fixtures.css`) to keep the project modular and organized.
